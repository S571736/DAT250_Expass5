## Doing the tutorials

Due to the helpfulness of the spring webpage and possibility to download a Spring tutorial project, there was no problem setting up the IntelliJ project.

The turial and steps of the turial was nice and easy to follow.

Spring seems like an interesting framework that I would like to use more in the future.

## Issues

None to mention.
